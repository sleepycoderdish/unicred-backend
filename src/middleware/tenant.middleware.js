/**
 * TENANT MIDDLEWARE
 *
 * Must run AFTER auth.middleware.js (req.user must already exist).
 *
 * Purpose: makes req.schoolId available so repository functions can
 * easily filter all queries by the user's school — enforcing multi-tenancy.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: schoolId always comes from the JWT (req.user.schoolId),
 * NEVER from req.body or req.query/params. Otherwise a malicious user
 * could pass a different school's ID and access another school's data.
